            <p>Pizza is an Italian dish consisting of a usually round,
                flattened base of leavened wheat-based dough topped with tomatoes, cheese, and often various other
                ingredients (such as anchovies, mushrooms, onions, olives, pineapple, meat, etc.), which is then baked
                at a high temperature, traditionally in a wood-fired oven. A small pizza is sometimes called a
                pizzetta. A person who makes pizza is known as a pizzaiolo.

            <p>Pizza is an emerging fast food in India. Domestic pizza brands include U.S. Pizza, Smokin' Joes and
                Pizza Corner. Branded pizza is available in most cities in India. India is the largest market for
                Domino's Pizza outside the US. Pizza brands feature greater "recipe localization" from pizza makers than
                many other markets such as Latin America and Europe, but similar to other Asian pizza markets. Indian
                pizzas are generally spicier and more vegetable-oriented than those in other countries. For instance,
                oregano spice packs are included with a typical pizza order in India instead of Parmesan cheese. In
                addition to spicier and more vegetable-oriented ingredients, Indian pizza also utilized unique toppings.
                For example, a pizza topping unique to India would be pickled ginger.

                Hamburger, a sandwich consisting of one or more cooked patties, placed inside a sliced bread roll or
                bun. A hamburger (or burger for short) is a food, typically considered a sandwich, consisting of one or
                more
                cooked patties—usually ground meat, typically beef—placed inside a sliced bread roll or bun. The patty
                may be pan fried, grilled, smoked or flame broiled. Hamburgers are often served with cheese, lettuce,
                tomato, onion, pickles, bacon, or chilis; condiments such as ketchup, mustard, mayonnaise, relish, or a
                "special sauce", often a variation of Thousand Island dressing; and are frequently placed on sesame seed
                buns. A hamburger topped with cheese is called a cheeseburger.

                The term burger can also be applied to the meat patty on its own, especially in the United Kingdom,
                where the term patty is rarely used, or the term can even refer simply to ground beef. Since the term
                hamburger usually implies beef, for clarity burger may be prefixed with the type of meat or meat
                substitute used, as in beef burger, turkey burger, bison burger, portobello burger, or veggie burger.

                A soft drink is a drink that usually contains water (often
                carbonated), a sweetener, and a natural and/or artificial flavoring. The sweetener may be a sugar,
                high-fructose corn syrup, fruit juice, a sugar substitute (in the case of diet drinks), or some
                combination of these. Soft drinks may also contain caffeine, colorings, preservatives, and/or other
                ingredients.

                Soft drinks are called "soft" in contrast with "hard" alcoholic drinks. Small amounts of alcohol may be
                present in a soft drink, but the alcohol content must be less than 0.5% of the total volume of the drink
                in many countries and localities if the drink is to be considered non-alcoholic. Fruit punch,
                tea (even kombucha), and other such non-alcoholic drinks are technically soft drinks by this definition,
                but are not generally referred to as such.
